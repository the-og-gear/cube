HOW TO RUN
==========

Just run the batch file. It's
that simple. Double click "run.bat"
or "run" or whatever it's called on
your machine.

In case that doesn't work, the only
command in that file is

java -jar "MyGame.jar"

This should allow you to run it, although
you might have issues. I can't help you
there. Use Google.

============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Java will be required. Should be
obvious, considering it's a java
project.
